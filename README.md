# Diffusion_model
In this I attempted to create a diffusion model
My whole ressearch was based on https://github.com/hkproj/pytorch-stable-diffusion
Video to which I refered : https://youtu.be/ZBKpAp_6TGI?si=w-3ShAKBOILChKvS
Further sd_2 is just same code as repo i have given above, I was just reseaarching and tried to recreate it in sd, but I was having  a few setbacks and still working on improving it so I just wanted to check if it works or not
Further I would advise you to refer to research papers on diffusion models for in depth because at last it is just converting somemaths equations to a code and I wud also advise to look after construction of  transfomers by yourself
Just create a few transformers using pytorch rather than jumping into it directly for clearity on what you actually are doing
